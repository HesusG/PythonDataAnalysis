# DA-Python-data-analysis-fundamentals-deprecated

## :wave: Welcome

This python data analysis project performs basic data wrangling and visualization techniques on a dataset, as well as connecting to a MySQL database using the dbplyr library. 
## ðŸ’» Description

The project begins by importing and cleaning the dataset, including tasks such as handling missing values and converting data types. Next, the project explores the dataset through various visualization methods, such as creating bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to gain insights into the data. Finally, the project connects to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, allowing for more advanced analysis and manipulation of the data. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and can serve as a foundation for further analysis.
